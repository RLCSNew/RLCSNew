        <h4 class="exp">Problem Solving/Relationship Building:</h4>
 <br><p>During the Cranford Basektball Camp this summer one of the kids on my team lost his belongings, and he was upset about it. Over the course of the week it was pretty obvious that some of the kids on the team were better friends with each other than others. My goal was to help them come together as a team. It ended up working because a lot of the other kids on my team saw that the kid was upset and offered to help. So we all went around looking and I told them that if they found it I would buy candy for the person that did.</p>

    <h4>Video Games:</h4>
    <br><p>Call of Duty ranked, and also Rocket League are constantly helping me communicate with my teammates to win. Another important thing I do now is that I am trying to learn more about what goes into games, so in a video game if I see a feature I think is cool I am looking at how would someone do it. </p>

    <h4>Programming:</h4>
    <br>The reason programming is a hobby and a skill for me is because it is something that I enjoy a lot. Recently it has become something I do throughout my day as it is something that I do for fun, which is great because it enhances my skills with different languages, while it is something that I enjoy. 

(I am familiar with HTML, C++, and currently learning the basics of python)
   
   <h4>Chess:</h4>
   
   <br><p> Before the chess boom I was already playing chess. I love strategy games where I have to think to win, it adds a skill gap where you can always improve because you will never be perfect. Now that most people play it adds a competetive side that made the game even more fun.</p>
